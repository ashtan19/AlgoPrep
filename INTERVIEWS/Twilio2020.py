Coding Assessment: 

Two questions

1) Vanity Phone Numbers
    Given a list of vanity codes and a list of phone numbers, find all the numbers that have vanity codes
    that match in the numbers in sorted order. eg. "+118001231111" and "ABC" return ["+118001231111"] because "+118001231-ABC"

2) Segmenting Long SMS Messages 
    Given a message, if message is longer than 160 characters, split the message into 160 char long segments 
    and adding a suffix (i/5) two each segment and return the array of segments. BONUS: split the message based without splitting words
